# **cfbscrapR 1.0.5**
-  Added [Eric Hess](https://twitter.com/arbitanalytics)'s [Visualizing Team Talent Using Player Recruiting Rankings](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/articles/nth-rated-recruit.html) vignette
-  Added [`cfb_calendar()`](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/reference/cfb_calendar.html) function from API
-  Updated [`cfb_team_roster()`](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/reference/cfb_team_roster.html) to reflect new parameters.

# **cfbscrapR 1.0.4**

-  Updated [`cfb_game_box_advanced()`](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/reference/cfb_game_box_advanced.html) to incorporate new columns from API.

# **cfbscrapR 1.0.3**

This was a **big** update!

-   Updated expected points models and win probability models
-   Add player and yardage columns to [`cfb_pbp_data()`](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/reference/cfb_pbp_data.html) pull thanks to a great deal of help from [\@NickTice](https://github.com/NickTice)
-   Add spread values to the [`cfb_pbp_data()`](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/reference/cfb_pbp_data.html) pull
-   Add drive detailed result with attempts at creating more accurate drive result labels
-   Added series and first down variables
-   Added argumentation to allow for San Jose State to be entered without accent into [`cfb_pbp_data()`](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/reference/cfb_pbp_data.html) function ```team``` argument.

# **cfbscrapR 1.0.22**

- ~~Fix conference parameters to match API (moved to abbreviation format).~~ Removed assertions for now, so users should be able to access conference data without issue, assuming the input argument is correct. May fortune favor your selection. 

- Add mgcv (>= v1.8.32) dependency and update WP model accordingly. Note on WPA: Kickoffs are problematic and our calculation algorithm does not appear to accomplishing what it needs to. We are working on this, aiming for a quick next version update centered around this. 

- Following play type renamings and merging:
  * Pass Interception Return --> Interception Return
  * Pass Interception --> Interception Return
  * Pass Interception Return Touchdown --> Interception Return Touchdown
  * Sack Touchdown --> Fumble Recovery (Opponent) Touchdown
  * Punt Touchdown ~ Punt Return Touchdown. 
  
- Update `rush_vec` and `pass_vec` regex definitions to be more precise on pulling rushing plays.

- Update definition of play_type definition for cleaning "Fumble Recovery (Opponent)" play types to actually distinguish between touchdowns and non-scoring opponent fumble recoveries (prior definition was combining the touchdowns into the non-scoring play type)

- Reduce the reach of the non-explicit rushing/passing touchdowns to be more careful about merging labels.

- Similarly, separated punt touchdowns into a specific type of offensive score where the punting team recovers a fumble and scores, all other `punt touchdowns` prior to this were punt return touchdowns. There is a specific Jalen Reagor (TCU) play where he pulls a Greg Reid and fumbles on the punt return only to recover the fumble and run it in for a 73 yard TD that is explicitly fixed.

- Add the following columns:
  - kickoff_onside
  - kickoff_fair_catch
  - kickoff_downed
  - punt_fair_catch
  - punt_downed
  - sack
  - int
  - int_td
  - completion
  - pass_attempt
  - target
  - pass_td
  - rush_td
  - safety
  
- add some return skeleton docs
- add column `drive_start_yardline` to the remove cols
- add parsing for kickoff safeties accounting for sign change

* Added [Jared Lee](https://twitter.com/JaredDLee)'s [animated win probability plot vignette](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/articles/Animated_WP_Plotting.html) to the package documentation page
  ![Result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saiemgilani/cfbscrapR/master/man/figures/animated_wp.gif)
  - Contains important `add_player_cols()` function useful to parse existing play-by-play datasets and pull passer/rusher/receiver/etc. player names. 
* Added [Michael Egle](https://twitter.com/deceptivespeed_)'s [4th down tendency plot vignette](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/articles/fourth_down_plot_tutorial.html) to the package documentation page

![WPA_YardsGained_cfbscrapR2.png](https://i.imgur.com/84zh9VY.jpg)

- Remove the [`add_betting_columns()`](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/reference/add_betting_cols.html) function and the current betting win probability model from the [`cfb_pbp_data()`](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/reference/cfb_pbp_data.html) function.
- Added [`cfb_ratings_fpi()`](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/reference/cfb_ratings_fpi.html) function from @sabinanalytics's fork of the repository
- Added the [`cfb_metrics_espn_wp()`](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/reference/cfb_metrics_espn_wp.html) function, courtesy of @mrcaseb
- Add [tests](https://github.com/saiemgilani/cfbscrapR/tree/master/tests/testthat) for a majority of the functions. This is the biggest behind the scenes change that will translate to more reliable functions. 
- Rename several function outputs from **camelCase to under_score** for consistency. Please adjust your scripts accordingly, apologies for the inconvenience.
- Remove `drives` parameter from [`cfb_pbp_data()`](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/reference/cfb_pbp_data.html) function. For accessing drives information, please switch to the [`cfb_drives()`](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/reference/cfb_drives.html) function.
